Design ideas -

Make everything define based - do not use any hardcoded values.

AES is a symetric cryptosystem, hence is uses the same key for encrypt and decrypt - hence it should use the same key. Key should be securely stored. 

Preprogram and store key on the registers - that's the way to do it. Registers should be accesible and key should be reprogrammable - it could be reprogrammed automatically by some cpu some certain amount of time.

For embedded testing - just do rtl to gatelist conversion and e2e tests.

Backend deals with physical design , it's opposite to front end which deals with logical design

#Arch#
Arch should include all blocks, signals, they description, registers (for keys and preprogrammed tables).
It basically should explain how chips works on the bit level - pretty much the same as AES algorithm.
